Alright. Welcome to getting comfortable with Terminal. A little bit about me, I am Ray Zhang, and I
am a junior studying Computer Science.

So, this talk is about terminal, a very important tool that you should all be very comfortable with.
This will cover a lot of the basics, so if you already know a lot about terminal or have been using
it for a while well...you're free to stay.

So what is terminal? Well, during the 1960s up until the 80s, the primary method of interacting with
the machine is through the Command Line Interface, or CLI. This CLI often implemented something called
a shell, which is an application that accepted text commands from the user and converted it to the
appropriate OS functions. As GUIs became more prevalent, CLIs have largely fallen by the wayside in
mainstream computing but for programming and software development, it is still one of the best tools
we have to interact with our operating systems. It is extremely versatile, allowing one to do such
things such as automation and scheduling, as well as having tools that have been perfected through
the decades to be as fast and efficient as possible. And if you have ever encountered a situation where
you are booted into emergency mode, it is very important that you are comfortable with navigating
around the terminal.

Let us start off with the basics, working the file system. Do all of you know what absolute and
relative paths are? (yes, no)
IF no THEN EXPLAIN paths
ELSE CONTINUE
Now, anything that you can do in whatever file explorer you can do in the terminal, oftentimes better
and more efficiently.
